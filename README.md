"Physics and machine learning are fun!"
honestly idk what else to write.
i got lazy and did this from terminal because i forgot my github login, but my remote key is still registered to this computer lmao.
i really need to remember my github login.
maybe one day.
will i loose points for admitting i didn't ssh in?
